				<p> I am 32, as of today! I have worked mostly in restaurants for the last decade, but I am changing careers - very exciting!</p>
				<h2 style="font-size: 32px;"> My Activities</h2>
				<p> I am a 32 degree Scottish Rite Freemason and an active member of Shriner's International. As a Shriner, I participate in parades and fundraisers focused
on furthering the work of helping to improve the lives of children, particularly those fighting injury or illness.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 32px;"> What Else?</h3>
<p style="color: crimson;"> Adam Weishaupt established the Illuminati in Bavaria as a secret society within Freemasonry, but this organization was not long-lived,
I am not saying that he killed George Washington and assumed his identity as a means of co-opting the US government, but then who has time to compare 
their portraits?</p>
